GALAGA
======

This is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Galaga for the Game Boy Advance developed in C for CS 2110 at the Georgia Institute of Technology by Jerry Wang (<jwang3450@gatech.edu>)

Description
------------

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and shoot at enemies that come down from the top. The goal is to not get hit by the enemies and to shoot them down before they reach the bottom. The game ends when you lose all your lives or when you defeat all the enemies.

Normal enemies move in a zig-zag pattern and shoot at you. Normal enemies have a random chance to turn into a rusher enemy, which moves in a straight line downwards and shoots at you.
